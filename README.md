# Ants AI Agent Protocol


## Overview

The Ants AI Agent Protocol is a protocol for building AI agents that can interact with each other.  Because the output of AI models is often fuzzy and not in the correct format, we will use the Pydantic `from_json` method to parse the output of the AI model.



## Core Concepts

### Agents

Agents are the main building blocks of the Ants AI Agent Protocol. They are responsible for executing tasks and communicating with other agents.

### Tasks

Tasks are the smallest unit of work in the Ants AI Agent Protocol. They are responsible for executing a single task and communicating with other agents.

### Tools

Tools are the smallest unit of work in the Ants AI Agent Protocol. They are responsible for executing a single task and communicating with other agents.
